# Bike Sharing - Final Project Data Analytics

This notebook is the final project submission for the "Belajar Analisis Data Dengan Python" course on Dicoding. It presents an analysis of the bike sharing dataset, covering Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. Additionally, a dashboard has been created using Streamlit. For additional details such as dataset background, characteristics, and file structures, please refer to the accompanying 'Readme' file. Further explanation won't be provided here.

## 2. Project work cycle

1. Data Wrangling:

- Gathering data
- Assessing data
- Cleaning data

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:

- Defined business questions for data exploration
- Create Data exploration

3. Data Visualization:

- Create Data Visualization that answer business questions

4. Dashboard:

- Set up the DataFrame which will be used
- Make filter components on the dashboard
- Complete the dashboard with various data visualizations

## 3. Getting Started

### `Proyek_Analisis_Data.ipynb`

1. Download this project.
2. Open your favorite IDE like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory (but in here I will use Google Colab).
3. Create a New Notebook.
4. Upload and select the file with .ipynb extension.
5. Connect to hosted runtime.
6. Lastly, run the code cells.

### `dashboard/dashboard.py`

1. Download this project.
2. Install the Streamlit in your terminal or command prompt using `pip install streamlit`. Install another libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn if you haven't.
3. Please note, don't move the csv file because it acts a data source. keep it in one folder as dashboard.py
4. Open your VSCode and run the file by clicking the terminal and write it `streamlit run dashboard/dashboard.py`.
